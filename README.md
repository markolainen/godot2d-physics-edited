Expanded version of Game Code Samurai's 2D engine found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxSLrhS6v-Q&amp;.

I (have so far) expanded with coyote time and jump buffering (1, 2 from https://twitter.com/MaddyThorson/status/1238338574220546049 ), as well ass now you can change the scale of the walls in the editor to resize them.
I only added the modified scripts, so you have to download the original main engine from https://github.com/yossielimelech/godot2d-physics .
